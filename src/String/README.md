# String

 ##   Strings are widely used in computer science and have many applications in various fields, some of which are:

Text Processing: Strings are used to represent and manipulate text data, such as in text editors, word processors, and other applications that deal with text.

Pattern Matching: Strings can be searched for patterns, such as regular expressions or specific sub-strings, to extract or process data in a specific way.

Data Compression: Strings can be compressed to reduce the amount of storage required to store them. String compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and run-length encoding, are commonly used in data compression applications.
