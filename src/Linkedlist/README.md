# LinkedList

A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science. It mainly allows efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays. Like arrays, it is also used to implement other data structures like stack, queue and deque. Hereâ€™s the comparison of Linked List vs Arrays

## Linked List:

- Data Structure: Non-contiguous
- Memory Allocation: Typically allocated one by one to individual elements
- Insertion/Deletion: Efficient
- Access: Sequential

# Array:

* Data Structure: Contiguous
* Memory Allocation: Typically allocated to the whole array
* Insertion/Deletion: Inefficient
* Access: Random
## Basics of Linked List:
1. Singly Linked List
2. Doubly Linked List
3. Circular Linked List

### Operations of Linked Lists:
* Length of Linked List
* Print Linked List
* Linked List Insertion
* Search in a Linked List
* Deleting a given key
* Deleting at given position
* Delete a Linked List
* Nth Node from Start
* Nth Node from End
* Size of Doubly Linked List
