# Tree
Tree Traversal refers to the process of visiting or accessing each node of the tree exactly once in a certain order. Tree traversal algorithms help us visit and process all the nodes of the tree. Since a tree is not a linear data structure, there can be multiple choices for the next node to be visited. Hence we have many ways to traverse a tree.

There are multiple tree traversal techniques that decide the order in which the nodes of the tree are to be visited. These are defined below:

## Depth First Search or DFS
- Inorder Traversal
- Preorder Traversal
- Postorder Traversal
- Level Order Traversal or Breadth First Search or BFS

## Postorder

- Traverse the left subtree
- Traverse the right subtree
- Visit the root 

## Preorder

- Visit the root.
- Traverse the left subtree.
- Traverse the right subtree.


## Inorder

- Traverse the left subtree
- Visit the root.
- Traverse the right subtree
